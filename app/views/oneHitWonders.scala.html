                    I've abandoned this project because of a lack of quality data source for song popularity. I may
                    revive it if I ever find something better than last.fm play counts (like say, Spotify opening up
                    their play counts to their API).

                <p>Defining a "big" one hit wonder as an artist who had one big hit, and very little success otherwise.</p>
                <p>
                For every artist that has appeared in the Billboard Top 40 at least once, but less than three times,
                    a "One-Hit-Wonderness" score was calculated. Using <a href="https://www.last.fm/home">Last.fm</a> to get
                    the total number of plays for an artist's top ten songs, their score was calculated by the following
                    ratio:
            </p>
                <p>(standard deviation of plays including top song) / (standard deviation of plays excluding top song)</p>
                <p>All artists with a score above 20 are ranked below. Included is the title of their top hit, as well as the year it was released.</p>
