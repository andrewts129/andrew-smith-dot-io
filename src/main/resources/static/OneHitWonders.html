            <h1>Who Were The Biggest One Hit Wonders? (WIP)</h1>
            <p>Defining a "big" one hit wonder as an artist who had one big hit, and very little success otherwise.</p>
            <p>
                For every artist that has appeared in the Billboard Top 40 at least once, but less than three times,
                a "One-Hit-Wonderness" score was calculated. Using <a href="https://www.last.fm/home">Last.fm</a> to get
                the total number of plays for an artist's top ten songs, their score was calculated by the following
                ratio:
            </p>
            <p>(standard deviation of plays including top song) / (standard deviation of plays excluding top song)</p>
            <p>All artists with a score above 20 are ranked below. Included is the title of their top hit, as well as the year it was released.</p>
